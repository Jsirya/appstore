### REST API

Note that the `REST_URL` depends on the build type you choose when installing the app:
  * `debug`: http://`<language>`.**test**.elimu.ai/rest/
  * `release`: http://`<language>`.elimu.ai/rest/

### Supported Languages

A list of the currently supported languages is available at https://github.com/elimu-ai/model/blob/master/src/main/java/ai/elimu/model/enums/Language.java

The first time you launch the Appstore application, it will ask you to select the language that you want to use from a drop-down menu.

For information on how to add support for a new language, see https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/blob/master/LOCALIZATION.md.
